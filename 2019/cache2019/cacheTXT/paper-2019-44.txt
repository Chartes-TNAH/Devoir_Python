Refining the Current Teaching Methodology of the TEI through the Analysis of Server LogsTEI 2019 Abstract Suggestions for Refining the Current Teaching Methodology of the TEI through the Analysis of Server Logs Luis Meneses, Electronic Textual Cultures Lab, University of Victoria, ldmm@uvic.ca Jonathan Martin, King’s College London, jonathan.d.martin@kcl.ac.uk Luis Meneses and Jonathan Martin Keywords: server logs, teaching methodology, TEI Guidelines Great emphasis has been placed lately on the pedagogy and practice of the TEI Guidelines [1]. In teaching and learning the TEI Guidelines we engage scholars in real research partnerships: allowing them to produce digital editions for their own studies and explore different aspects of their texts through different perspectives. We believe that the next step in the evolution of the TEI is developing training materials, which aligns with Greatthe emphasis that has been placed lately on the pedagogy and practice of the TEI Guidelines –which was the main theme of the 2017 conference (“TEI Victoria 2017” 2019)[1].. The materials for learning the TEI Guidelines are still in early stages –consisting primarily of past project documentation, the TEI’s own introductory materials, online tutorials, and collected examples – which leads to skills being acquired in unsystematic ways . Additionally, the Guidelines have evolved and become more rigorous and theoretical –making some of these training materials overwhelming and unpractical for newcomers who might not be familiar with text encoding. As proponents of the TEI Guidelines, In teaching and learning the TEI Guidelines we engage scholars in real research partnerships: allowing them to produce digital editions for their own studies and explore different aspects of their texts through different perspectives.As the Guidelines have matured and become more rigorous and theoretical, we have an disciplinary obligation to develop equally rigorous adequate and standardized appropriate training materials for new learners. The current TEI Infrastructure consists of a set of servers and services , allowing the Guidelines to be primarily accessed online. A server log is a file automatically created and maintained by a server consisting of a list of activities it performed. For our purposes, a statistical analysis of server logs can be used to examine Web traffic patterns. In this abstract, we propose to analyze the TEI server logs in order to propose offer suggestions to refine the teaching methodology based on what parts of the Guidelines are more frequently accessed –while also considering what is not accessed often. Additionally, we are aware that customizations of the Guidelines exist that aim to meet the majority of the needs of TEI user community –(for example, TEI Lite ). However, formal justifications for which elements are included and excluded in them do not exist. This proposal interrogates and theorizes how we might present the TEI Guidelines as better teaching materials and aims to foster the development of skills and activities of future scholars.
