<p rend="bold">Genesis and Variance: From Letter to Literature</p>
<p>ABSTRACT: The paper examines the nature of textual genesis and textual variance,
                based on a letter which was later elaborated into an epistolary novel.</p>
<p>KEYWORDS: textual variance, textual genesis, alignment, critical apparatus</p>
<p>The study of textual genesis, as introduced by Karl Lachmann<note n="1" place="foot" xml:id="ftn1">Cfr. Plachta, B. (2013). <hi rend="italic">Editionswissenschaft</hi>. 3rd ed. Stuttgart: Reclam, 27–45.</note> and
                pursued by many others, makes comprehensible that text is a dynamic medium. During
                its composition in temporal succession, text is constantly revised, reorganized, and
                reshaped. Within this process, even context and genre can be subject to change:
                drafts turn into stories, and whole novels derive from tiny notes.</p>
<p>Documents are what is left of such textual dynamics. Understood as physical
                manifestations of text, documents appear as stable entities, which can relatively
                easy be digitized, transcribed, and described. The current standard guidelines for
                text encoding seem ideal for both machine- and human-readable representations of
                documents, and they strongly support document-related studies of all     
           disciplines.</p>
<p>However, in order to pursue the question of what “text really” might be, the encoding
                philologist should also take a look beyond the document and refocus the attention on
                the examination of textual processes.<note n="2" place="foot" xml:id="ftn2">Cfr.

                encoding stategies are necessary to represent them? How could variance be described
                and classified, e. g. by distinguishing formal, stylistic, paratextual and
                contentwise variants?<note n="3" place="foot" xml:id="ftn3">Roeder, T. (2018). <hi rend="italic">Vom authentischen Brief zur durchgestalteten Literatur</hi>.

                current standards sufficient to represent textual dynamicity, or do they favor
                document oriented, but less dynamic concepts of text?</p>
<p>The idea of this paper is based on an autobiographical text by Friedrich Rochlitz, an
                author of the early 19th century, who wrote an eye-witness report of the Battle of
                Leipzig (1813) to a close friend in Dresden.<note n="4" place="foot" xml:id="ftn4">Roeder, T. (2018). <hi rend="italic">Tage der Gefahr</hi>. [Blog] Digital
                    Humanities am DHIP. Available at: <ptr target="https://dhdhi.hypotheses.org/4493"/> [3 Oct. 2018].</note> During
                the siege, the letter could not be dispatched. Rochlitz continued writing his letter
                until the war was over, and finally, his friend received a very long and
                impressively detailed letter.<note n="5" place="foot" xml:id="ftn5">SLUB Dresden,

                    Rochlitz über die Begebenheiten in Leipzig (1813).</note> Without the author’s
                consent, the letter was forwarded to other interested readers. Possibly due to
                positive feedback from the latter, Rochlitz decided to elaborate the letter into a
                novel, which was published first in 1816, and as a revised edition in 1822.<note n="6" place="foot" xml:id="ftn6">Rochlitz, F. (1816). Tage der Gefahr. In: <hi rend="italic">Neue Erzählungen</hi>, 2, Leipzig/Züllichau: <hi rend="color(#000000) background-color(#ffffff)">Darnmannsche

<p>While the variants between the two printed editions can be described and presented by
                means of a classical TEI inline apparatus,<note n="7" place="foot" xml:id="ftn7">Cfr. TEI: Critical Apparatus. [online] <hi rend="italic">P5 Guidelines for

                    July 2019].</note> the textual difference between Rochlitz’ original letter and
                the first edition in print requires a standoff based alignment method, including
                ambiguities and uncertainties. But does it make sense to combine different encoding
                methods for one textual history? Does it make more sense to separate variants from
                witnesses? And which concept of textual dynamics is implied by the decision for a
                specific markup method?</p>
