                TEI: A corpus-oriented approach for investigating Tibetan historiography<ptr target="#id_OrgXref.orga472947" type="bookmark-end"/>

<p>Mathias Fermer (mathias.fermer@oeaw.ac.at)</p>
<p>My presentation addresses a system for deriving historical evidence from Tibetan
                primary sources by applying semantic markup to the texts' key entities (i.e.
                persons, places, literary works and artefacts). This markup system follows the
                TEI-P5 guidelines and has been developed in the framework of the Sakya Research
                web-application (<ptr target="https://sakyaresearch.org/"/>) which holds a large
                corpus of machine-readable sources in Classical Tibetan, ranging from medieval
                chronologies and histories to illustrious life stories of Buddhist masters.</p>
<p>The markup applied to the digital collection has been designed in line with the
                historiographical nature of the texts: It captures information about historic
                agents, the places they visited, as well as artefacts and literary works mentioned
                in varying contexts along the chronological sequence of the individual texts.</p>
<p>Using TEI-markup in this way has proven particularly useful in my own research for
                depicting the social, geographical, artistic and doctrinal contexts of the texts'
                narrative subjects (and their authors). It allowed for tracking teacher-student
                relationships and exploring the geographic expanse of those masters' regional
                networks, to give two examples for how the empirical evidence from TEI-encoded texts
                can be assessed.</p>
<p>I will address the concept behind this markup and its potential for a quantitative,
                intertextual analysis that goes beyond single texts. What can Tibetan historians
                gain from markup-technology, if systematically applied to a wider corpus of
                literature?</p>
<p>I will argue that the data deriving from a consistent annotation of primary
                literature on a large scale will gradually change our understanding of Tibetan
                history. At the same time, such a corpus-oriented approach to historiography raises
                several conceptual and practical questions about how, and in which form encoded
                information can best be stored, analysed, displayed and reused.</p>
