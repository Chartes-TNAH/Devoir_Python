  Recreating history through events Events are a feature of life in space and time and hence are frequently encountered in             witnesses of the human culture. Coming from diverse backgrounds within the TEI based realm of scholarly editing, the             authors identified a common practice in digital editions for encoding events: dateable             events are commonly recorded and marked up using e.g. simple date when="*" structures.             To date, there is no easy single solution to model events that include basic other event             features, mainly referring back to the questions of what happened when and with             whom/what as subjects and objects of any given event. There are numerous examples from generically and disciplinarily varying editions where a             unified way of describing events could provide added value. Our showcase examples             feature material as diverse as  a) a medieval itinerary and medieval calendars,  b) an Austrian author’s diary from the 1950s,  c) a corpus of governmental minutes from the Habsburg empire and  d) 16th century political correspondence.  We will propose a common strategy on how to encode events in a way that can be             easily parsed and extracted from TEI source files. After careful consideration, we propose minor changes to the event and listEvent             elements. To allow for multiple levels of reporting on events, we will discuss a nested             and typed way of distinguishing between describing and described events. Merging data on historical events from various sources will provide for a closer linking             of text editions. It will also provide data for an enriched historical background by             linking events across editions. We hope to enable the TEI community to generalize what             has lately been successfully adopted for correspondences under the correspSearch label –             including a web service –, while staying in line with the generic norms and the specific             needs that arise from other types of sources.
