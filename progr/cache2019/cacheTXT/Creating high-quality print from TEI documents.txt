  Creating high-quality print from TEI documents Even in the age of digital editions a need for high-quality print versions of TEI                     documents remains, be it a print version of a single document or a book edition                     of a complete or partial digital edition. Of course, there is XSL-FO but the                     typesetting quality obtained by the freely available Apache FOP does not live                     up to very high demands. Obviously, one can yield to one of the commercial                     XSL-FO engines which do a rather impressive job. However, even the best XSL-FO                     engines are bound by the inherent limitations of XSL-FO which are crucial for                     critical editions, e.g. for formatting a complex text-critical apparatus. Fortunately, there has been a freely available typesetting system since the early                     1980s whose quality is widely acknowledged, namely LaTeX and the underlying TeX.                     The use of LaTeX for creating scholarly editions is therefore well-established                     (cf. the reledmac package                     and its predecessors). Likewise, LaTeX has been utilised before for typesetting                     TEI documents, e.g. within the XSL stylesheets for                     the TEI framework. However, using XSLT for transforming TEI documents to various                     formats has drawbacks, especially a rather high degree of redundancy and the                     consequential pain of maintenance. Luckily enough, the TEI Processing Model and ODD come to our rescue. They provide                     means for adding LaTeX to the output formats without too much hassle. Using the                         TEI Publisher Libraries complex requirements can be easily realised                     within the TEI ODD in a descriptive, standardised way. This paper demonstrates how the portal of the Law Sources Foundation of                         the Swiss Lawyers Society utilises the TEI Processing Model and LaTeX                     for preparing high-quality print versions. We will also propose two simple                     extensions to the TEI Processing Model, pb-template and                         pb-behaviour, which make it easier to generate arbitrary LaTeX from                     within the ODD using a straightforward template syntax As our implementation proves, with those minimal                     extensions the Processing Model becomes powerful and generic enough to cover                     complex, high-quality print.
