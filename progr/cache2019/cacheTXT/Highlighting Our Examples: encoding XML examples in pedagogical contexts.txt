 Highlighting Our Examples: encoding XML examples in pedagogical contexts  The TEI Guidelines use the egXML element throughout the prose and reference pages for containing XML examples. However, many TEI users             know little about this element, and most don’t even realise that it is not even in the usual TEI namespace, but             instead in a TEI examples namespace (http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples).  Following on from my paper at TEI2018 (in which I proposed more detailed ways that the TEI Guidelines might handle             examples more generally), this paper will look at possible improvements to the egXML element, specifically             designed for modern pedagogical uses. When creating TEI ODD customisations as local encoding manuals, users sometimes             use egXML to show how encoders             should mark up particular textual phenomena, similar to the use in the Guidelines themselves. Expanding this element’s             functionality could benefit not only the TEI Guidelines, but also all those who include snippets of XML markup in             encoding manuals, slides, tutorials, exercises, or anything else possibly derived from (or exported to) a TEI source             and beyond.  Building on the kind of syntax highlighting we are familiar with in XML editors and code snippets online, this paper             examines the need to highlight arbitrary portions of XML stored in an egXML element. Whether encoding             existing resources containing highlighting of XML or wanting to render modern born-digital pedagogical materials, the             TEI Guidelines currently recommend no specific way to do this.  This paper looks at a number of possible options for enabling the highlighting of egXML markup, including             embedding namespaced elements, out-of-line markup, and byte-offset coding. All of these are summarised, with the             problems that they each face, not only in processing, but also in providing flexible methods to enable users to             express existing or desired output rendition.
