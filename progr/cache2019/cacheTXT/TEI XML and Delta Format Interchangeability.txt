  TEI XML and Delta Format                     Interchangeability   Authors    Nicholas Cole, University of Oxford; David                     De Roure, University of Oxford; Pip Willcox, The National Archives   Abstract   This paper will interrogate the close link                     between TEI and XML, and examine whether the information encoded by TEI could be                     more easily processed (for certain applications) by expressing it in alternative                     formats. In particular, this paper will examine the rise of various socalled                     ‘Delta’ formats in the JavaScript ecosystem, that are particularly popular with                     projects developing multi-user, collaborative editors, and which express the                     structure and features of text by separating the text itself from the list of                     attributes associated with each block, line, or character. This offers several                     advantages for processing, and allows such documents to take advantage of an                     emerging ecosystem.   As this paper examines, for certain                     applications, such as the representation of negotiated texts, it offers an                     ability to represent and manipulate rich-text, annotated data in a way that is                     not possible in traditional TEI formats because algorithms to manipulate delta                     formats exist that have no comparable (implemented) analogues for XML                     documents.   This paper will lay out the current state                     of competing ‘delta’ formats, the advantages they offer in separating text from                     the attributes that describe it, the problem that some of these popular but                     poorly-defined formats would have encounter in trying to express a TEI document                     in a lossless fashion, whether a translation layer between TEI XML and such a                     format would be possible to achieve, and whether the academic, text-processing                     ecosystem would benefit from an alternative format that draws on such ideas,                     particularly as a transient format (with import/export to/from XML) for editing                     and data-processing within particular applications. Given the poorly defined                     state of some other useful but evolving formats, this paper will examine whether                     efforts by the DH community to standardize versions for academic purposes and                     link them to the current TEI standard would bear fruit.
