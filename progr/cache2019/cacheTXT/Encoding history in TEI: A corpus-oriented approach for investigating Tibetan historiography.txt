   Encoding history in                 TEI: A corpus-oriented approach for investigating Tibetan historiography  Mathias Fermer (mathias.fermer@oeaw.ac.at) My presentation addresses a system for deriving historical evidence from Tibetan                 primary sources by applying semantic markup to the texts' key entities (i.e.                 persons, places, literary works and artefacts). This markup system follows the                 TEI-P5 guidelines and has been developed in the framework of the Sakya Research                 web-application () which holds a large                 corpus of machine-readable sources in Classical Tibetan, ranging from medieval                 chronologies and histories to illustrious life stories of Buddhist masters. The markup applied to the digital collection has been designed in line with the                 historiographical nature of the texts: It captures information about historic                 agents, the places they visited, as well as artefacts and literary works mentioned                 in varying contexts along the chronological sequence of the individual texts. Using TEI-markup in this way has proven particularly useful in my own research for                 depicting the social, geographical, artistic and doctrinal contexts of the texts'                 narrative subjects (and their authors). It allowed for tracking teacher-student                 relationships and exploring the geographic expanse of those masters' regional                 networks, to give two examples for how the empirical evidence from TEI-encoded texts                 can be assessed. I will address the concept behind this markup and its potential for a quantitative,                 intertextual analysis that goes beyond single texts. What can Tibetan historians                 gain from markup-technology, if systematically applied to a wider corpus of                 literature? I will argue that the data deriving from a consistent annotation of primary                 literature on a large scale will gradually change our understanding of Tibetan                 history. At the same time, such a corpus-oriented approach to historiography raises                 several conceptual and practical questions about how, and in which form encoded                 information can best be stored, analysed, displayed and reused.
