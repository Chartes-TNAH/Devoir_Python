 Inscriptions, Hieroglyphs, Linguistics... and Beyond! The Corpus of                 Classic Mayan as an Ontological Information Resource Franziska Diehr, Sven Gronemeyer, Uwe Sikora, Christian Prager,                 Maximilian Brodhun, Elisabeth Wagner, Katja Diederichs, Nikolai Grube Answering the question “What is text, really?” may be impossible, for                 ‘text’ being a most complex resource, fulfilling numerous purposes, manifested in                 diverse documents types with unique characteristics. To study ‘text’ using digital                 methods, some kind of representation is required. The project ‘Text Database and                 Dictionary of Classic Mayan’  For more information on the project, see:    compiles the hieroglyphic texts written by the ancient Maya in a                 machine-readable corpus. We do so with an approach fitting the idea of “TEI and                 beyond”: ‘Text’ is represented as separate information resources, each described by                 an ontological model representing the specific semantics and complexities of the                 material. Using different formats (RDF, XML) and standards (CIDOC-CRM, TEI-P5), the                 inscriptions are encoded in a multi-level corpus:  The corpus further consists of (4)                         an ontological-based RDF-schema for historical and scholarly information and                         physical features of text carriers, and (5) the ‘Maya Image Archive’ for                         photographic and archival material, for which we use the DARIAH service                         ‘ConedaKOR’: .                       (1) a TEI-all conform schema defining values and rules for the                 encoding of the text’s topological and structural features, (2) a ‘Sign Catalogue’                 for the classification of Maya hieroglyphs (Diehr et al.), and (3) the tool ‘ALMAH’                 for linguistic analyses (Grube et. al, 5-7). Maya writing is not yet fully deciphered, not all signs are known, and                 we still deal with competing reading hypotheses and a missing Unicode character                     set.  There are efforts in                         this direction (Pallan Gayol, Anderson), but in their current form they do                         not meet the classification requirements of the Maya script. These                         challenges are also present in other ancient, non-alphabetic writing systems                         (Rossi, De Santis). The interdisciplinary working group EnCoWS (Encoding                         Complex Writing Systems) was set up in 2015 for the purpose of harmonising                         encodings.  To represent the script, we use stand-off markup to                 enable an interlinked structure between distributed sources: The TEI encoding serves                 as central data source, embedding other information (Fig. 1). Maya glyphs are                 grouped in blocks, each usually containing more than one in different                     arrangements.   Depending                             on space requirements and aesthetics, individual signs merge, overlap,                             be infixed, or rotated, depending on the sign shape                             and space within the block.    Using @rend and @corresp represents this structure by describing the                 position to the neighboring glyph.   By using @corresp to refer to the neighboring glyph, we mimic a                             numerical transliteration (similar to the ‘Leiden                             Conventions’), but in a more precise way: With support of the TEI semantics and the XML syntax an unambiguous                             description of the glyph arrangement is                             provided.   The project will encode approximately 10,000                     texts.   The data will                             successively be made accessible under a CC BY-4.0 license on our                             project portal (https://www.classicmayan.org/)                             which is currently in the stage of conception. Furthermore, the corpus data will also be published in the TextGrid                             Repository (https: //textgridrep.org/), where they                             can also be accessed by external users via OAI-PMH. The RDF data of the Sign Catalogue will be also retrievable at the                             portal via a SPARQL endpoint and also at the TG                             Rep.   To support the workflow, we developed a parser that                 creates the according TEI/XML structure out of a project-specific sign number                 transliteration (Grube et. al, 2-3). In our approach, ‘text’ is understood as a multi-level information                 resource in form of an ontological corpus, offering different views and access                 points to the material, providing a holistic environment for studying Classic                 Mayan.    Figure 1: Within tei:g the value of attribute @ref refers to the URI ofthe                         graph recorded in the Sign Catalogue. Its ontological structure links                         thegraph to its linguistic expression, to which a transliteration value is                         assigned.
