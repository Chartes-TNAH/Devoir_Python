  Native-TEI dialectal dictionary for Bavarian dialects in Austria: data                     structure, software and workflow   1,2 Jack Bowers,  1 Philipp Stöckle,  1 Ludwig Maximilian Breuer,  1 Hans Christian Breuer   1Austrian Center for                 Digital Humanities, Austria  2Inria - ALMAnaACH,                 France This paper discusses the use of TEI in the creation of dually born-digital and print                 dictionary as part of the Dictionary of Bavarian Dialects in Austria (Wörterbuch der                 bairischen Mundarten in Österreich ‘WBÖ’). Also we discuss the creation of a                 lexicographic editor tool that allows the non-TEI expert lexicographers to create                 TEI articles in background of a user-friendly interface. This work being carried out is a continuation of a legacy project which began in 1913                 when data began to be gathered throughout the Bavarian dialect area of the Austrian                 Empire. The source material being used for the creation of the new articles was                 collected and elicited using questionnaires and recorded on paper slips. Vocabulary                 continued to be collected until the 1990’s when the analogue records were converted                 to a TUSTEP database. Recently the database of more than 2.4 million entries has                 been converted to TEI (Bowers & Stöckle 2018). At the core of this project are several issues which are particularly significant in                 the TEI, notably: a) the use of TEI as primary data format for the creation of both                 a print and digital resource; b) the lexicographic editor tool which provides a                 user-friendly and open-source alternative to Oxygen XML editor in the creation of                 systematic and standardized TEI articles using ODD and YAML formatter; c) the                 structural approach to dialectal dictionary entries in TEI (an                 under-established/peripheral usage of the module). In our talk we describe the                 specifics of each of these components of the project and expand upon what has been                 previously presented about this work in Bowers et al. (2018a,b), focusing                 particularly on the TEI article structure and the editor tool.  Works cited  Bowers, J., & Stöckle, P. (2018a).
