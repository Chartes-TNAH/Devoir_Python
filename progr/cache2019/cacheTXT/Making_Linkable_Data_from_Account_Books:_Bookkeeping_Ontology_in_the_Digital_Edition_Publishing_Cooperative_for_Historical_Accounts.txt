 Making Linkable Data from Account Books: Bookkeeping Ontology in the Digital Edition                 Publishing Cooperative for Historical Accounts Christopher Pollin and Kathryn Tomasek TEI2019, University of Graz Historical accounting records, a genre of manuscript document that can be encoded in                 TEI/XML, can be a rich source about local social and economic relationships in the                 past as well for comparative purposes. With the Digital Edition Publication                 Cooperative for Historical Accounts (DEPCHA), documentary editors and developers in                 the United States collaborated with digital humanists at the Zentrum für                 Informationsmodellierung (Centre for Information Modeling) at the University of Graz                 to apply a bookkeeping ontology to accounts. The main use cases for this project are the Financial Papers of George Washington                 (Stertzer), accounting records from a store on the Stagville Plantation in North                 Carolina (Brumfield and Agbe-Davies), and a day book kept by Laban Morey Wheaton, a                 businessman who kept a dry goods store in Norton, Massachusetts, between 1828 and                 1859 (Tomasek and Bauman). This paper focuses on a workflow for creating linkable data using the TEI @ana attribute. While the Wheaton edition was                 created using TEI-XML, the data for the Washington Financial Papers and for the                 Stagville store were created using Drupal and FromthePage, respectively.                 Transformation to TEI-XML for these records is an interim step for creating the RDF                 for linking on the Web of Data (Pollin 2019). Examples will be drawn from the                 Stagville/FromthePage and Wheaton/TEI-XML data. Upcoming work on building a bridge                 from Drupal to TEI-XML is part of the project’s ongoing research agenda. Part of the workflow for creating RDF includes use of WikiData and OpenRefine. Since                 the currency, goods, and services exchanged had contextual meanings grounded in both                 place and time, ongoing work also focuses on mapping information from taxonomies                 based on the digital editions of the primary sources to Historical Statistics of the                 United States, a long-standing project in U.S. economic history. Examples will                 include an alpha-version TEI taxonomy drawn from this source. Future work will                 involve mapping taxonomies from the Washington Financial Papers onto this TEI                 taxonomy and expanding it accordingly.
