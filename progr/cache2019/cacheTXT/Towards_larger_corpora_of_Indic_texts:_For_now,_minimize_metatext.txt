 Towards larger corpora of Indic texts: For now, minimize metatext Himal Trikha (himal.trikha@oeaw.ac.at)   The Digital Corpus of                 Vidyānandin’s works (DCVW) is an ongoing collection of digital text resources for                 the works of a 10th century Sanskrit author. The resources are assembled and                 maintained in the context of my Indological research specialization, i.e., the                 history of an Indian philosophical tradition. A web interface () allows to access the resources and, to                 some extent, modify them. The digital resources are XML-files that are processed by a bundle of technologies in                 order to pursue specific research interests: search for text strings, identification                 of dialogic or intertextual elements, differences between attestations etc. In this                 context, the quality of the results depends on the quality of the resource files,                 which are assessed by three basic criteria: (a) status of the separation of text and                 metatext, (b) quality of the captured text and (c) compliance of the metatext to an                 established terminology. For the latter I use TEI markup on basically two levels:                 (1) markup for a precise identification of the attestation of the text and its                 specific editorial features and (2) markup to enrich the text from the perspective                 of my own research interests.  The presentation will provide examples for the applied markup. I will argue that the                 use of tag sets within the first category is certainly an indispensable prerequisite                 for long term efforts to build larger and larger corpora of Indic texts. The tag                 sets within the secondary category, on the other hand, seem to be of no relevance                 for this goal. The energy invested in the refinement of technically demanding tag                 sets is an asset for scholars who are so inclined. In the current state of Digital                 Indology, however, it is still necessary to develop standards for the discipline as                 a whole before we can start to agree on the basic ones.
