<head>Using Microsoft Word for preparing XML TEI-compliant digital editions</head>
<p>The paper will introduce the so-called electronic editions prepared in Microsoft
                    Word text processor. This tool was originally developed in 2000 in order to
                    generate so-called vertical format for a corpus manager and in 2008 it was
                    modified in order to output XML TEI format for the Manuscriptorium project
                    (National Library of the Czech Republic 2019). For capturing structural
                    information (headings, indices etc.) and the semantics of the individual parts
                    of the edition (notes, readings etc.) the editors use character and paragraph
                    styles whose application is described in Černá and Lehečka (2016). The
                    methodology also includes rules of transforming the individual styles into XML
                    format according to the TEI P5 Guidelines (The Text Encoding Initiative
                    Consortium 2019). An add-in for Microsoft Word was programmed to help editors to
                    apply formatting and other necessary parts of the edition, e.g. page and line
                    numbers. The author of the paper will focus on DOCX document conversion to XML
                    TEI P5 format. The conversion which consists of approximately 60 sequentially
                    applied XSLT transformations (World Wide Web Consortium 2009) is driven by a
                    specialized application (programmed in C#). In order to keep as much of “the
                    editor’s intent” as possible and reduce errors resulting from the transformation
                    process (omitted or duplicated text) an electronic tool was created which
                    extracts plain text (divided into basic text and annotations) from the input
                    (DOCX) and target document (XML TEI P5). This can be carried out by a much
                    smaller number of XSLT transformations (only 6 stylesheets). The output text is
                    subsequently compared via text comparison tools, e.g. WinMerge (2013): differing
                    text chunks point to problematic passages, where transformation to XML format
                    fails. With these tools approximately 240 editions of Old- and Middle-Czech
                    texts (from 1300–1800) was prepared during 10 years, currently attracting new
                    potential users across institutions.</p>
