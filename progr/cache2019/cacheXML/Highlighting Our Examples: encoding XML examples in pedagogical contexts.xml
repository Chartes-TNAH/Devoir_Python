<head>Highlighting Our Examples: encoding XML examples in pedagogical contexts</head>
<p> The TEI Guidelines use the <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-egXML.html">egXML</ref> element throughout the prose and reference pages for containing XML examples. However, many TEI users
            know little about this element, and most don’t even realise that it is not even in the usual TEI namespace, but
            instead in a TEI examples namespace (<ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples</ref>). </p>
<p>Following on from my paper at TEI2018 (in which I proposed more detailed ways that the TEI Guidelines might handle
            examples more generally), this paper will look at possible improvements to the <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-egXML.html">egXML</ref> element, specifically
            designed for modern pedagogical uses. When creating TEI ODD customisations as local encoding manuals, users sometimes
            use <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-egXML.html">egXML</ref> to show how encoders
            should mark up particular textual phenomena, similar to the use in the Guidelines themselves. Expanding this element’s
            functionality could benefit not only the TEI Guidelines, but also all those who include snippets of XML markup in
            encoding manuals, slides, tutorials, exercises, or anything else possibly derived from (or exported to) a TEI source
            and beyond. </p>
<p>Building on the kind of syntax highlighting we are familiar with in XML editors and code snippets online, this paper
            examines the need to highlight arbitrary portions of XML stored in an <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-egXML.html">egXML</ref> element. Whether encoding
            existing resources containing highlighting of XML or wanting to render modern born-digital pedagogical materials, the
            TEI Guidelines currently recommend no specific way to do this. </p>
<p>This paper looks at a number of possible options for enabling the highlighting of <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-egXML.html">egXML</ref> markup, including
            embedding namespaced elements, out-of-line markup, and byte-offset coding. All of these are summarised, with the
            problems that they each face, not only in processing, but also in providing flexible methods to enable users to
            express existing or desired output rendition. </p>
