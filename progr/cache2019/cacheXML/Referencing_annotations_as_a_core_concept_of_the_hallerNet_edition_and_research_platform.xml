<p>May 2019 saw the launch of 
        
        <ref target="https://hallernet.org">hallerNet</ref>, a platform revolving around prominent
            actors of the Enlightenment and nature research in eightteenth century Switzerland.
            HallerNet aims to illuminate the transformation of the early modern <emph>République des
               Lettres</emph> into the modern scientific community and its discipliniary
            differentiation by combining digital source editions with a very rich body of
            prosopographical and bibliographical research data.</p>
<p>Whereas the online platform is brand new in its current shape, the underlying metadata
            was compiled over a span of almost three decades. From the outset, the main focus of the
            data collection was on Haller’s correspondence, the actors related to it and
            bibliographic information – pertaining to Haller’s works, his library but also a vast
            amount of secondary literature of note –, and resulting in encompassing print
            publications such as <title level="m">Repertorium zu Albrecht von Hallers Korrespondenz
               1724–1777</title> (<ref target="#Boschung" type="bibl">Boschung et al. 2002</ref>)
            and <title level="m">Bibliographia Halleriana</title> (<ref target="#Steinke_2004" type="bibl">Steinke and Profos 2004</ref>). These endeavors led to a
            voluminous research database with considerable depth (<ref target="#Steinke_2003" type="bibl">Steinke 2003</ref>), built up between 1991 and 2016 and
            subsequently transformed into TEI (cf. <ref target="#Recker-Hamm" type="bibl">Recker-Hamm and Stuber 2015</ref>, <ref target="#Stuber_2019" type="bibl">Stuber,
               Daengeli and Forney 2019</ref>). With the onset of a large project on Albrecht von
            Haller’s reviews and letters, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation
            (2018–2023), all ca. nine thousand extant reviews by Haller will be edited in
            conjunction with some eight thousand thematically related letters (on their relationship
            cf. <ref target="#Stuber_2004" type="bibl">Stuber 2004</ref>).</p>
<p>This undertaking, again, relies heavily on earlier research and more specifically on a
            series of printed editions of Haller’s correspondence, which provides the basis for the
            encoding of more than half of the selected letters. The proposed contribution will
            discuss the process of the <emph>digitisation</emph> and re-working of such print
            predecessors. Specifically, the fate of the footnote shall be pondered and the chosen
            solution in the context of hallerNet editions presented, both on the level of the TEI
            encoding and the presentational rendering. When developing the data model of these
            re-editions it quickly showed that porting existing annotations from footnotes in print
            to footnotes in the digital edition would not leverage the full potential of the new
            environment. Instead, as much information as possible is attached to references to
            database objects (persons, institutions, publications, plants and so on). Only critical
            (philological) annotations and historical information that cannot be related to a
            database object is retained in footnotes.</p>
<p>The implemented model for annotated references is straightforward and basically consists
            of notes in referencing strings. In the course of the re-edition, information on, e.g.,
            the social position or the place of activity of an actor as it may be given in a legacy
            footnote is brought over to the respective database object, from where it may be queried
            also from other occurrences. Consequently, this interweaving of textual data with
            extensive metadata makes it possible to evaluate this kind of information not only for a
            single letter, but also for a correspondence as a whole and in doing so to derive and
            compare social profiles of specific correspondences (<ref target="#Sonntag" type="bibl">Sonntag, Stuber and Forney 2019</ref>).</p>
<p>A guiding principle of the migration from the (relatively) private database to TEI was
            to allow for more openness. For one, both the transcribed documents but also the gist of   
         the database objects will be made available in public in a FAIR repository. In addition
            to this, the data will also be retrievable directly from the platform in a
            programmatical manner. To this end the database objects are related to authority files
            wherever possible so that the information may be shared with other projects and
            resources. Besides using existing interfaces such as <ref target="https://correspsearch.net/">correspSearch</ref> and integrating the data
            with, e.g., <ref target="https://histhub.ch/">HistHub</ref> and <ref target="https://www.metagrid.ch/en/">Metagrid</ref>, it will be very interesting to
            provide access to specific bits of the valuable knowledge contained within the hallerNet
            platform through nascent interfaces such as <ref target="https://github.com/GVogeler/prosopogrAPhI">prosopogrAPhI</ref>.</p>
