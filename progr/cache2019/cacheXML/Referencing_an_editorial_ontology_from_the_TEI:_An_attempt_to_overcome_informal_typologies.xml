<hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">Referencing an editorial ontology from the TEI: An attempt to overcome informal typologies </hi>
</p>
<p>Jakub Šimek (Heidelberg University Library)</p>
<p>The introduction of TEI P5 in 2007 was accompanied by efforts of mapping contents of
                TEI documents to high level conceptual models like CIDOC CRM. They focused on
                prosopographical information connecting the textual content with index metadata.
                Moreover, a flexible use of the <hi style="font-family:Courier">&lt;taxonomy&gt;</hi> element was implemented, allowing for ontology-like
                thesauri which can be referred to by pointers from an edition.</p>
<p>While these mechanisms for named entities and terms enable powerful indexing, little
                attention so far has been given to formalizing the ways of dealing with editorial
                and documentary typologies which are used in attributes like e.g. <hi style="font-family:Courier">@type</hi>, <hi style="font-family:Courier">@function</hi> and <hi style="font-family:Courier">@reason</hi>. These
                typologies refer to document types, textual and editorial phenomena, the processes
                of text production and text redaction and similar categories of concepts which
                characterize the text itself rather than external entities referred to by the
                textual content.</p>
<p>Attributes like <hi style="font-family:Courier">@type</hi> do not permit the use of
                pointers to formal conceptual definitions as their expected data type is <hi style="font-family:Courier">teidata.enumerated</hi>, not URI pointers (although
                the <hi style="font-family:Courier">&lt;equiv&gt;</hi> element in ODD specifications
                could map different XML components to formal URIs externally). </p>
<p>This paper presents the attempt made at the Heidelberg University Library to enable
                in TEI documents pointers to definitions of editorial phenomena administrated in a
                OWL ontology (“heiEDITIONS Concepts”) in order to replace <hi style="font-family:Courier">teidata.enumerated</hi> attributes with URI pointer
                mechanisms. This strategy makes use of a few TEI attributes like <hi style="font-family:Courier">@ana</hi> whose data type is <hi style="font-family:Courier">teidata.pointer</hi> and some additional pointer
                attributes provided by a schema extension. A “private URI scheme” stated in the TEI
                header allows the use of abbreviated URI forms. </p>
<p>The goal of this institutional strategy is not only a standardization of the TEI
                encoding adopted by in-house edition projects and cooperative endeavours but also a
                transparency in documentary and editorial terminology used in TEI code. </p>
