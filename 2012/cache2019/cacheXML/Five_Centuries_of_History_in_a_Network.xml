<p>How should historical researchers encode texts that will be used as primary sources for
            network analysis? Moreover, how can they link together the various layers of this
            encoding in a way that explicitly shows the encoder’s methodology and interpretations?
            This presentation is intended to demonstrate and solicit feedback on an experimental
            procedure applicable to projects producing networks from historiographical texts.</p>
<p>The project <title ref="https://usaybia.net">Communities of Knowledge: Interreligious
               Networks of Scholars in Ibn Abi Usaybiʿa’s History of the Physicians</title>
               (<ref target="https://usaybia.net">https://usaybia.net</ref>)<note n="1" place="bottom">Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and
               Research.</note> is conducting a network analysis of interactions among Muslim,
            Christian, and Jewish scholars across five centuries of Abbasid rule in the Near East
            (750–1258). The primary source text for this endeavor is an Arabic biographical
            dictionary written by Ibn Abi Usaybiʿa, a physician active in Cairo and Damascus in
            the 13th century. This <title>History of Physicians</title> details teacher-student
            relations, workplace exchanges, correspondence, oral reports, and other interactions
            among the scholars mentioned.</p>
<p>The network analysis based on this historiographical text requires a way to proceed from
            encoding a source text in TEI to producing a dataset for network analysis. Along the
            way, it must document at least two layers of interpretation: (1) the primary source
            author’s portrayal of events and (2) the researcher’s own understanding of these
            assertions. One way to make these interpretive layers explicit is to isolate individual
            “factoids” as analytical units. Encoding factoids in TEI and RDF has been recently
            pioneered by Daniel L. Schwartz for the Syriaca.org project “SPEAR: Syriac Persons,
            Events, and Relationships.” The current project extends this by producing factoids
            directly from a primary source and integrating them into the encoded text, as well as by
            further refining the process of curating resulting factoids into nodes and edges for
            network analysis.</p>
