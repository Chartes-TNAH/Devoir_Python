<p>One of the missions of <ref target="#tei-eaj" type="bibl">Special Interest Group for
                    East Asian/Japanese (hereinafter SIG EAJ)</ref> is the dissemination of TEI in
                Japan. A characteristic of Japan in comparison with TEI-advanced countries in North
                America and Europe is that the culture which utilizes XML-related technologies such
                as XSLT and XQuery have not been widespread. In addition, methodologies of research
                for textuality have not widely been treated among humanities researchers in Japan.
                In this paper, we discuss how to spread TEI in such TEI-underdeveloped countries
                based on the activities of SIG EAJ.</p>
<p>One of our activities is the hands-on sessions which handle Aozora Bunko texts. <ref target="#aozora" type="bibl">Aozora Bunko</ref> transcribes public domain works
                like Project Gutenberg, and about 20,000 texts are available in its original format
                and HTML. This hands-on session aims to provide not only the opportunities to learn
                TEI by the converting practice but also the TEI-compliant Japanese texts on the Web.
                We are also preparing a comprehensive set of tutorials for Japanese resources using
                    <ref target="#github" type="bibl">GitHub</ref>. Sections such as how to write
                the TEI header, how to encode plays have been created so far. Through these
                sessions, more than 20 texts were encoded in conformance with Level 3 of Best
                Practice for TEI in Libraries. In addition, we are developing visualization tools
                using JavaScript such as <ref target="#ceteicean" type="bibl">CETEIcean</ref>, and
                the program which automatically converts Aozora Bunko texts into TEI in the Level 2
                of the practice.</p>
<p>By coupling with compiling tutorials and accumulating markup examples targeting
                Aozora Bunko texts, we have gained in-depth knowledge of markup on modern Japanese
                texts. Through this activity, the number of people who are familiar with TEI is
                getting increased. Moreover, in countries where XML-related technologies have not
                been widespread such as Japan, JavaScript tools can work well to share the benefits
                of TEI. This point is considered to be helpful in the spread of TEI in other
                TEI-underdeveloped countries.</p>
