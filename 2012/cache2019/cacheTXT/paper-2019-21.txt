Introducing Objectification: when is an <object> a <place>?Introducing Objectification: when is an <object> a <place>? The TEI Guidelines recently (as of TEI P5 version 3.5.0, January 2019) added elements for describing objects and encoding the names of objects. These elements include: objectName, object, listObject objectIdentifier, as well as changes to many other elements to loosen their descriptions slightly. This paper will introduce these new elements to TEI users who many not have had the chance to use them yet, as well as introduce potential uses for the encoding of object descriptions in TEI files. The paper will not, however, merely introduce these elements, but will also look at changes still to be done in the TEI Guidelines to fully support the description of objects. For example, much of the object description content model is taken wholesale from that for describing manuscripts. The objectIdentifier was based on the msIdentifier (with some important changes), and object still has elements like msContents in its content model. There are many changes that are still needed and this paper actively seeks to involve the community in designing these changes. Changes are not only required to existing content models of elements, but also to clarify the semantics of the distinctions between elements. Using examples of large objects such as the Central Library of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) (c.f. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Library_(UNAM)), which has substantial and important mosaics on its external walls, this paper will ask where the border lines are between what one might consider an object and what might instead be encoded as a place. Concluding that the difference lies in the markup intent (as with so much in the TEI), this paper draws a distinction between encoding for object description, and geo-political entities.
