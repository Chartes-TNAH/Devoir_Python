Reconceiving TEI models of theatrical performance text with reference to promptbooksJennifer Roberts-Smith and Joey Takeda with Janelle Jenstad, Mark Kaethler, and Toby Malone Reconceiving TEI models of theatrical performance text with reference to promptbooks This paper explores and suggests a revision to the conceptual model of “dramatic text” currently evidenced in TEI discourse. Our critique arises out of the challenges our research team has encountered developing an encoding protocol for promptbooks in the collection of the Canadian Stratford Shakespeare Festival Archives. We have argued elsewhere that promptbooks—by which we mean the promptbooks defined by Charles H. Shattuck (1965) as the “book[s] actually used by prompters or stage managers in conducting performances” (1965, 5)—are ontologically distinct from other forms of theatrical performance texts in the sense that “a promptbook records a series of utterances to which intended performance events are mapped in a relative temporal sequence” (Roberts-Smith et al. 2019). In this paper, we work through the implications of that claim for the TEI Guidelines, and suggest a reconceptualization of TEI’s discursive model of theatrical performance texts based on: long-acknowledged limitations of the existing Guidelines to address the complex ontologies of a “dramatic work” (Mylonas and Lavagnino 1995); a summary of more recent theoretical work on the ontologies of dramatic and theatrical/performance texts (including frameworks proposed by Osborne 1996; Clopper 2001; Erne 2003; Schafer 2006; Kidnie 2009; Worthen 2005, 2010, 2011; Werstine 2012; Roberts-Smith et al. 2013; Griffin 2018); and a survey of existing TEI Guidelines for Performance Texts (TEI 7), TEI listServ discussions (with a focus on the 2001 debate among Tobin Nellhaus, Syd Bauman, Sperberg-McQueen, and others Note that full thread is not available via the TEI listServ as it appears some of the discussion happened “off-list”. See Nellhaus’ initial post https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=TEI-L;efa95b0.0103 and Bauman’s reply: https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=TEI-L;2973394d.0104 ), and other TEI extensions, including the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI). Our central argument is that the tension between event and text that Mylonas and Lavaigno see as problematic in encoding “dramatic works” (1995) applies neither to performance texts traditionally understood as such nor to promptbooks. A more functional conceptualization in TEI would accommodate dramatic, theatrical/performance, and prompt texts as three distinct ontologies. We offer a short list of sample modifications to the TEI Guidelines for discussion. References Bauman, Syd. (2001 April 12). “Re: TEI and drama”.
